# Diabetes_System
A system thet predicts whether you are diabetic or not based on variou factors. These factors include:
#### polyuria --a large number of diabetic individuals experience polyuria(passing a large number of urination.

##### polydipsia - (intense thirst) --diabetic individuals are more likely to report polydipsia.

##### sudden weight weakness -- Diabetic individuals tend to experience sudden weight loss.

#### weakness --Diabetic individuals tend to experience sudden weakness

I used data collected from a hospital in Nyeri, kenya which was anonymised and i used it to come with the following conclusions:
##### Higher Risk Age Group: Diabetes cases are more frequent between ages of 40 and 60, showing a higher risk for middle aged individuals

#### Lower Risk Age Group: Individuals under 30 have a lower likelihood of diabetes

### Summary
While diabetes is more common in older groups, some young individuals are still affected
